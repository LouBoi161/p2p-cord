# P2P Cord

A serverless, peer-to-peer communication platform inspired by Discord.

## Features

- **Real-time Communication**: Voice and Video calls using WebRTC.
- **Screen Sharing**: Share your screen with peers in the room.
- **Serverless Architecture**: 
  - No central signaling server.
  - Uses **Hyperswarm** (DHT) for peer discovery and signaling.
  - Media streams are direct P2P (mesh topology).
- **Persistent Rooms**: Rooms are saved locally.
- **Identity**: Usernames are synced across peers.

## Architecture

### Signaling & Discovery
The application uses a Decentralized Hash Table (DHT) via `hyperswarm` to discover peers.
1. Room names are hashed to generate a unique 32-byte topic.
2. Clients join the swarm for this topic.
3. Upon connection, peers establish a direct TCP-like connection through the swarm.
4. This connection is used as the "Signaling Channel" to exchange WebRTC SDP offers/answers (generated by `simple-peer`).

### Media
- **WebRTC**: Used for high-performance audio/video streaming.
- **Mesh Network**: Each peer connects to every other peer in the room (Full Mesh).
